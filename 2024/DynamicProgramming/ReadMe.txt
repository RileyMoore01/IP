LeetCode's Dynamic Programming Prep
Here are my notes divided into the courses sections.


Intro  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things to note when thinking about using DP
  1.) The problem can be broken down into "overlapping subproblems"
  2.) The problem has an "optimal substructure" - soultions for the overlapping subproblems

Greedy Problems - optimal substrucutre, but not overlapping subproblems
Divide & Conquer Algorithms - break a problem into subproblems, but these subproblems are not overlapping (which is why DP and divide and conquer are commonly mistaken for one another)

Strategic Approach  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Common Patterns  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Dynamic Programming for Paths in a Matrix  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
